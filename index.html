            <p>My name is Gage. Like I said the first day of class, I got into making websites last year because I was annoyed with having to find a new gaming website everytime one got blocked at school so I decided I would just make my own. My website actually got pretty popular and I had things on it such as game recommendations, school wide polls using google polls, and an escape hatch that would take you to a school friendly website when you moused over it in case a teacher was walking over to you.</p>

<p>I actually did learn a lot about making websites on my own with the help of google but I was spending so much time on the website that I stopped paying attention in most of my classes. It is actually the reason I got my first D in a math class, which is weird for me because I've been in accelerated math since 3rd grade.</p>

<p>I decided that it was pretty obious to me how much I enjoyed making websites so I started looking into classes I could take on making websites to turn it into a job possibility. I actually tried to join the bootcamp before this one but I was too young because I didn't turn 18 until this past July, but now that I'm old enough I'm excited to learn.</p>
